# Instancio-JS

Instancio-JS is a library for dynamically and recursively generating
JavaScript/TypeScript objects from interfaces, similar
to the functionality provided by [Instancio](https://github.com/instancio/instancio) in Java.
It allows you to quickly create objects with random values for testing purposes.

## Features

- **Random Object Generation**: Generate objects based on interfaces/classes with random values.
- **Recursive Generation**: Supports generating nested objects and recursive structures.

## To come

- **Customizable Generation Rules**: Easily customize generation rules with preset values.

## Installation

To install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install instancio-js
```

# FIX ME

TODOs :

- end implem + test coverage, handle all cases (type unions, classes, interfaces) + custom random generation, field setting....
- Deploy V1 + create public git repos (with instancioJS org)
- contact org https://github.com/instancio and see if instancio-js should be a part of it
